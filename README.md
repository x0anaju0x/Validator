This project presents a set of MySQL stored procedures aimed at validating and manipulating different types of input data. It includes procedures for verifying the validity of Brazilian CNPJ (Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jur√≠dica) numbers, validating email addresses using regular expressions, and separating last names from full names. These procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity and accuracy in applications that handle corporate tax identification numbers, email addresses, and personal names. The CNPJ validator calculates the check digits using specific weights and algorithms, the email validator applies a standard regex pattern to check the format, and the name separator splits the last name from the rest of the name by identifying the last space character. These tools enhance data validation processes, making them reliable and efficient.
